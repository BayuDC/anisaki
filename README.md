## üìñ Background

Anisaki is a simple website that aims to display anime airing schedule.
This project was inspired from https://www.livechart.me/timetable and https://anime-today.com.
They are great and useful website that provides a lot of information,
but i want a simple version, so i created this project.
The name anisaki comes from the words "anime" and "saiki"(it is a javanese word for "now").
